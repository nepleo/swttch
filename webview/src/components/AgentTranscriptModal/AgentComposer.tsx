/**

 *
 * The claim is a guess, and it needs an end: a resume that completes between
 * two renders is never seen as `running` at all, and a workflow agent's resume
 * becomes a separate task whose `running` never lands on this one. Either way
 * nothing would arrive to take the stop button back down, and it would sit
 * there for the rest of the session offering to stop something already over.
 *
 * Long enough to cover the round trip — the model has to notice the request and
 * call SendMessage, then the agent has to restart — and short enough that a
 * button pointing at nothing is not left standing.

/**
 * Say something to an agent, from the view of that agent.
 *
 * Literally the session input's own frame and parts: `InputFrame` draws the
 * box, and `RichInput` and `ActionButtons` fill it. Nothing about the shape is
 * restated here, so the two cannot drift — a change to the frame reaches both.
 *
 * The whole `ChatInput` could not come along. It is 905 lines with no props at
 * all, reading the session, the stream and the input state straight from
 * context, which is a fair design for the one composer a screen has and the
 * wrong shape for a second one pointed somewhere else.
 *
 * `RichInput` gets no `className`, exactly as it does there: what it is handed
 * is applied to its two stacked layers (the editable and the mirror that paints
 * under it), not to the box around them — so styling it that way misshapes the
 * editor instead of the container, and the container is what this file owns.
 *
 * Three of the session bar's controls are absent rather than inert.
 * `SendMessage` carries a plain string, so an attachment has nowhere to go; a
 * slash command addresses the session, not the agent in front of you; and the
 * mode, model and context-window tags all describe the session rather than
 * this exchange.
 *
 * Nothing is echoed here. Resuming an agent makes the CLI fire a fresh
 * `task_started` carrying this text as its `prompt`, so the message appears in
 * the transcript above from the CLI's own record rather than from a second copy
 * of ours that could disagree with it.
