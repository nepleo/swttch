/** Final on-disk locations the backend serves from. */
data class ExtractedResources(val webviewDir: File, val backendFile: File)

/**
 * Extracts the plugin's bundled `webview/` static files and `backend.mjs` from the
 * plugin JAR into a **version-scoped** directory, at most once per
 * (IDE product, plugin version). Replaces the previous per-project-root extraction
 * in [NodeProcessManager] that caused issue #149.
 *
 * ## Why version-scoped, extract-once, never-delete-on-exit (issues #57, #120, #149)
 *
 * The bundle content depends only on the plugin *version* (same version → identical
 * `index.html`/`assets/`/`backend.mjs`), never on the project root. The old code keyed
 * the temp dir on `project.basePath.hashCode()` and re-extracted (delete + unpack) on
 * every backend spawn, then deleted the dir on process exit (#120). Because the path
 * was deterministic per root, successive backend *generations* shared it, so an old
 * generation's exit-cleanup deleted the dir a new generation was actively serving →
 * HTTP 404 `Not found` (#149).
 *
 * This extractor removes all three failure modes at once:
 *  - **Key = plugin version** under [baseDir]: every project root shares one dir, so no
 *    per-root duplication and no per-root accumulation (#120).
 *  - **Extract once, skip if present**: no destructive re-extraction of a live dir (#57).
 *  - **Never delete on process exit**: nothing races a serving dir (#149). Stale *other
 *    version* dirs are pruned right after a successful extraction instead.
 *
 * ## Concurrency & atomicity — why there is no lock (issue #308)
 *
 * Two IDE instances sharing a [baseDir] can extract the same version concurrently, and
 * that is safe on its own: each unpacks into its own sibling `.tmp-<uuid>` dir under the
 * *same parent* as the final dir (guaranteeing the same volume), verifies the hashed
 * bundle **before** renaming, and then publishes by rename — so the version dir never
 * appears half-written no matter how many processes race. `ATOMIC_MOVE` falls back to a
 * non-atomic replace when the platform/filesystem rejects it, and to a `.locked-<uuid>`
 * serve-in-place dir when even that fails (see [moveIntoPlace]).
 *
 * Earlier versions also took a `.lock` file here. It never guarded correctness — the
 * rename above already does — it only avoided the *waste* of two processes unpacking the
 * same bundle. That trade turned out to be a bad one: the wait was unbounded, so a
 * leftover backend process still holding the lock stalled every new start until the 30s
 * resource gate in [NodeProcessManager] gave up, surfacing as
 * `Node.js backend failed to start / Plugin resources not ready`. On Windows that holder
 * survives closing the IDE, which left rebooting the machine as the only way out. Paying
 * a rare duplicate unpack is strictly cheaper than that, so the lock is gone; a leftover
 * `.lock` file from an older version is deleted on sight by [pruneOtherVersions].
 *
 * Dev mode (running from the source tree) returns the source `webview/dist` and
 * `backend/dist/backend.mjs` directly and never extracts — the version-key scheme
 * applies to production JAR extraction only.
