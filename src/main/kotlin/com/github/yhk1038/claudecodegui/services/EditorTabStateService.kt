/**
 * Persists which Claude Code editor **tabs** are open so they can be restored
 * after an IDE restart.
 *
 * Terminology — this service deals exclusively with **tab IDs** (the per-tab
 * UUID minted when an editor tab is opened), NOT Claude Code conversation
 * session IDs. The only place a conversation appears is the stored *path*
 * value (a WebView URL like `/sessions/{conversationId}/...`), which is opaque
 * to this service.
 *
 * NOTE: the persisted [EditorTabState] field names (`openSessionIds`,
 * `activeSessionId`, `sessionPaths`) are kept as-is on purpose — they are the
 * on-disk XML schema (`claudeCodeEditorTabs.xml`) and renaming them would break
 * restore for existing users. Their *values* are tab IDs; the public API below
 * uses the correct `tabId` vocabulary.

         * ## Why this exists (issue #438)
         *
         * Creating this service on the EDT crashed the IDE's error reporter for a
         * user whose project lived in WSL. The chain is entirely inside the
         * platform, so nothing about our own code looks dangerous at the call site:
         *
         * 1. creating the service makes the platform load `claudeCodeEditorTabs.xml`;
         * 2. loading a project XML expands path macros;
         * 3. expanding them calls every `ProjectWidePathMacroContributor`, one of
         *    which is the Maven plugin's;
         * 4. the Maven one asks EEL for the local repository path, and **when the
         *    project is not on a local file system** (WSL, remote dev, dev
         *    containers) that call blocks;
         * 5. blocking is forbidden on the EDT, so the platform throws
         *    `IllegalStateException: This method is forbidden on EDT`.
         *
         * A local project never reaches step 5, because EEL short-circuits for a
         * `LocalEelDescriptor` — which is why this was invisible on macOS and on a
         * plain Windows checkout, and only ever reported from WSL.
         *
         * So the rule is not "avoid the Maven plugin", it is: **the EDT must never
         * be the thread that creates this service.** Callers that can run that
         * early ask with this method and do without the state when the answer is
         * null, letting a background thread
         * ([com.github.yhk1038.claudecodegui.startup.ChatHostRestoreActivity]) be
